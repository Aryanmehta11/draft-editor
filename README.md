# Draft.js Editor

This is a simple text editor built using [Draft.js](https://draftjs.org/), a powerful React-based framework for building rich text editors. The editor supports basic inline styling such as **bold**, *italic*, underline, and custom header formatting. Additionally, the content is automatically saved to `localStorage` to persist across page reloads.

## Features
- **Inline Styling**: 
  - **Bold** (`*text*`)
  - **Red Line** (`**text**`)
  - **Underlined** (`***text***`)
  - **Header** (`# text`)
- **LocalStorage Persistence**: Saves editor content to `localStorage`, so it remains even after page reloads.
- **Custom Styling**: Custom styles are applied for different inline styles like bold, red line, underlined text, and headers.
- **React & Draft.js**: This project utilizes `React` for the UI and `Draft.js` for handling rich text editing.
